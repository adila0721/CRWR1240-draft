This is a working draft of a blog posting. The actual text starts here, after the 'front matter' above. I am writing a paragraph. When I want to create a new paragraph, I hit the enter key twice to create a blank line.

This is a new paragraph. Don't indent it with a tab or spaces. (Tabs and/or spaces have a meaning in Markdown, and they change your formatting.)
