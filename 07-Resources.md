# Readings and Resources

Please read Stephen King's book _On Writing_ and Robert Pirsig's _Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance_. Reading is a core task for the writer. But, more generally, try to use the hacker's approach in this class:

> You… have to develop a kind of faith in your own learning capacity — 
> a belief that even though you may not know all of what you need to solve a problem, 
> if you tackle just a piece of it and learn from that, you’ll learn enough 
> to solve the next piece — and so on, until you’re done.
> --- <cite>Raymond, E. S. (2001). How to become a hacker.</cite>
