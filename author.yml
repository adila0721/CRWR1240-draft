# Below, change "example" to your first and last name, with a dash between.
# So, if your name is Norrin Radd, you would replace the word `example` with 
# the name 'norrin-radd' (lower case, and without the quotation marks). 
# On the following lines, replace the fields for your name, email address, 
# GiHub username, and `about` description. 
# Note: The author name that you use here (replacing `example`) must be exactly 
# the same as the author name that is shown on the `author` line at the top of your draft.

example:
  name:              Your Name
  email:             address@something.com
  about:             |
    Here is where you add something about yourself. Replace this text -- but 
    note that the inendation of this text is required. Each line must be 4 spaces (not tabs) 
    indented from the left. Write roughly 100 words here.
